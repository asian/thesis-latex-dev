\section{Evaluation and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion_discussion}

In this thesis, a new model is developed for POLSAR data.
The theory development is based in the principles of statistical mathematic and is visualized using computer simulations.
The theory has shown its capabilities through a number of applications, though further studies should unearth even more interesting results.

The main assumption used in this paper is the independent and circular complex Gaussian model for POLSAR data.
While the model may not be perfectly matched with practical data,
  it is apparently the most-widely accepted model.
In the following paragraphs, the imperfect practice of over-sampling   data in SAR and POLSAR processing is discussed.

The practice of over-sampling in SAR (and hence POLSAR) data processing may affects the choice of nominal ENL for showing the match between real-life data and the proposed model.
Specifically, the over-sampling practice would normally be indicated a reduction of the ENL number.
This is for example evidenced in our experiment for the RADARSAT2 dataset.
The RADARSAT2 given to us is in its Single-Look format,
  and nine-look processing is applied before the dispersion histogram in log-transformed domain is computed for an homogeneous area.
The histograms for both one-dimensional SAR and two-dimensional partial POLSAR data are plotted in Fig ???
  against the theoretical model for the nominal ENL value of 9.
Even though the shapes of the histograms do look similar, the match however is not very good.
A better match can be achieved by estimating the ENL from the observable variance of the log-determinant,
  and the theoretical model for the estimated ENL indicated a much better consistency.
This procedure can always be carried out for any given dataset,
  since the sample variance of the log-determinant can always be measured
  and hence the effective ENL can always be estimated using Eqn. ???.

The use of covariance matrix log-determinant may be related to the standard eigen-decomposition method of the second order statsitics POLSAR matrices.
In fact, the log-determinant can also be computed as the sum of log-eigen values.
Specifically:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ln{|M|} = \sum \ln{\lambda_M}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda_M$ denotes all the eigen-values of M.
Similar to other eigen-value based approach (e.g. Entropy/Anisotropy, ...),
  the models presented here is roll-invariant.

The methodology presented in this paper call for the reduction of the multi-dimensional POLSAR data into a scalar value.
While this is probably desirable for a wide range of application where a one-dimensional number is required to represents the complex multi-dimensional data,
  such reduction is probably not lossless.
Thus similar to the way the Wishart Classifier is employed,
  the use of this technique should be complemented with some high-dimensional POLSAR target-decomposition techniques (e.g. Freeman Durden or entropy/anisotropy TODO:REF ...)

%\subsection{POLSAR Consistent Measures of Distance}
        
%\subsubsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, several scalar and consistent measures-of-distance for multi-variate POLSAR data were proposed in this paper.
The dis-similarity measures are computed for the determinant of the POLSAR covariance matrix,
  which when converted into one-dimensional data
  is gracefully transformed into the traditional SAR intensity.
Consequently, these measures of dis-similarity may be employed in a wide range of application
  where a scalar number is required to represent the complex multi-dimensional POLSAR data.
Just like it is shown for the simpler case of SAR data processing\cite{Le_2010_ACRS},
  when these distances are computed in the log-transformed domain,
  their theoretical statistic models become additive and homoskedastic.
The models are shown to be theoretically powerful.
Not only they can provide alternative and sometimes simpler explainations to a range of theoretical concepts:
  i.e. change detection test statistics or ENL estimation
but also a number of results for one-dimensional SAR can be shown as special cases of the POLSAR models.
They are also pratically versatile enough
  capable of explaining the imperfect over-sampling practice evident in RADARSAT2 data.
Finally, to extend our previous work in evaluating SAR speckle filters,
  the applicaton of these additive and homoskedastic distances in the context of evaluating POLSAR speckle filters is briefly explored
  with promising results reported.
        
%\section{Possible Future Work and Conclusion}

\section{Possible Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion_future_work}

As the additive noise PDF in log-domain has been worked out, we hypothesize that the true back-scattering coefficient PDF, also in log-domain, can be estimated through regularized deconvolution algorithms.
If an algorithm could be designed to estimate such PDF, we believe this would present an improvement for a whole class of speckle filters, namely the Maximum-A-Priori (MAP) class, which up to now, still assumes the true PDF will follow certain known fixed distributions.
%It is hoped that with the true PDF now being estimatable from the data itself, a better speckle filtering algorithm, in log-transformed domain, can be developed.

For multi-channel SAR data, as reviewed in Chapter 2, speckle filtering for the off-diagonal element $S_hS_v^*$ of the covariance matrix is still an open question.
Our observation has been that these elements are also available in dual-polarization SAR data, they specifically are part of Stokes parameters.
As mentioned earlier, Stokes parameters have been largely ignored in polarimetric literature, until recently asserted again by Raney in 2006 \cite{Raney_2006_IGARSS}.
Mathematically, Stokes parameters can be written as:
\begin{equation}
S = 
\left(
	\begin{array} {c}
		S_hS_h + S_vS_v \\
		S_hS_h - S_vS_v \\
		2 \Re{(S_hS_v^*)} \\
		2 \Im{(S_hS_v^*)}
	\end{array}
\right)
= 
\left(
	\begin{array} {c}
		S_hS_h + S_vS_v \\
		S_hS_h - S_vS_v \\
		S_+S_+ - S_-S_- \\
		S_lS_l - S_rS_r
	\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
We have evidence, and hypothesize that $S_+S_+$, $S_-S_-$, $S_rS_r$, $S_lS_l$ will have the same physical and statistical properties as the normal $S_hS_h$, $S_vS_v$.
If our hypothesis can be proven rigorously, it may then be possible to build and validate a statistical model for all elements in the covariance matrix of Polarimetric SAR data, namely $S_hS_h$, $S_vS_v$, $\Re{( S_hS_v^*)}$, $\Im{( S_hS_v^* )}$.
Also, speckle filtering on off-diagonal elements can be carried out using techniques, that were originally developed for single-channel SAR data, and up to now is only applicable to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.

%\subsubsection{Theory Development and Research Strategy}
For single channel SAR data, we propose the use of a log transform to evaluate speckle filter's performance. 
We have proved that homoskedasticity property is indeed manifested in the log-domain.
The traditional performance index in comparing speckle filters, i.e. the Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL), has also been shown to be related and calculable from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) inside the log-domain.
We are working to prove that, with the homoskedastic property asserted, the universal Mean Squared Error can be a good performance indicator, even on heterogeneous spatial variations.

Furthermore, as the point spread function (PSF) is available in the log-transformed domain, it appears that, for the first time, the histogram of the underlying back-scattering coefficient may become estimate-able. 
In figure 
	\ref{fig:noise_pdf_as_psf:conv_inputs}, 
the underlying single channel gray image histogram is presented along with the noise PDF, in the log-transformed domain. 
As the noise is additive, it is expected that the noise PDF will act as a point spread function.
This makes the observable speckled image histogram mathematically equivalent to the convolution of the original image's histogram and the noise PDF.
This fact is evidenced in figure 
	\ref{fig:noise_pdf_as_psf:conv_output_observable}, 
where except for the un-calibrated shifting, the shapes of theoretical convolution and observed histogram are reasonably similar.
We hypothesize that: given the observable SAR data and its histogram, it should be possible to estimate the original underlying signal's histogram through some regularized deconvolution methods.
We intended to start by applying the Richardson-Lucy algorithm \cite{Richardson_1972_JOptSocAm, Lucy_1974_JAstronomical} for such estimations.

For multi-channel SAR data, we focus on partial polarimetric SAR satellite data.
Attempts have been made to model the data, especially the off-diagonal covariance matrix elements, i.e. $S_hS_v^*$.
However, the models are overly complicated which made proposed PolSAR speckle suppression algorithms became overly complex (see polarimetric data modelling section in Chapter 2).
We preferred an alternative approach.
We propose to transform the polarization basis of dual-polarized SAR data to help estimate this element.

We first pick up a recent revelation by Raney, 2006 \cite{Raney_2006_IGARSS}, that the back scattering waves' polarization captured in dual-pol data can be completely described using Stokes parameters.
%From the usually given pairs of $S_h$ and $S_v$, Raney has shown that Stokes parameters can be computed.
Furthermore, Stokes parameters can be measured in multiple polarization basis, which can also be synthesized from the given data (see polarization basis transform section in Chapter 2).
%Both transformations, i.e. from $\{h,v\}$ to circular basis $\{l,r\}$ and from $\{h,v\}$ to $\{+\pi/4,-\pi/4\}$ modes, are special cases of the transformation formula.
That is:
	the measured signal at $\pi/4$ linear polarizer as: $\xi_+ = \frac{\xi_h + \xi_v}{\sqrt{2}}$,
	at $-\pi/4$ linear polarizer as: $\xi_- = \frac{\xi_h - \xi_v}{\sqrt{2}}$, 
	at left circular polarization as: $\xi_l = \frac{\xi_h + i \xi_v}{\sqrt{2}}$, 
	and at right circular polarization as $\xi_r = \frac{\xi_h - i \xi_v}{\sqrt{2}}$.

The Stokes vectors, when aligned at these transformed projections are given by the following well-known equation:
\begin{equation}
S_t = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 |\xi_h|^2 + |\xi_v|^2 \\
 |\xi_h|^2 - |\xi_v|^2 \\
 2 \Re( \xi_h \xi_v^* ) \\
 2 \Im( \xi_h \xi_v^* ) 
\end{array}
\right)
= \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 |\xi_+|^2 + |\xi_-|^2 \\
 -2 \Re( \xi_+^* \xi_- ) \\
 |\xi_+|^2 - |\xi_-|^2 \\
 2 \Im( \xi_+^* \xi_- ) 
\end{array}
\right)
= \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 |\xi_l|^2 + |\xi_r|^2 \\
 2 \Re( \xi_l^* \xi_r ) \\
 -2 \Im( \xi_l^* \xi_r ) \\ 
 |\xi_l|^2 - |\xi_r|^2 
\end{array}
\right)  
\end{equation}

Evidently, the real and imaginary parts of $S_hS_v^*$ is closely related to Stokes Parameters.
Specifically they may be considered as the subtraction of two random SAR intensity variables, e.g., $|S_l|^2 - |S_r|^2$. 
%Since ShSh is exponential this can be calculated through convolutions, if each channels are independent. 
%Laplace distribution is the difference between two identical exponential distributions. 
For the same traditional reasoning of $|S_h|^2$ and $|S_v|^2$, we hypothesize that all the four intensities calculated from the transformation of polarization basis, i.e., $|S_+|^2$, $|S_-|^2$, $|S_l|^2$, $|S_r|^2$, follow negative exponential distributions. 
The hypothesis is supported by our preliminary experiment results, where we synthesize the basis transformed intensity from real-measured polarimetric data.
It then follows that $S_hS_v^*$ can be despeckled by independently de-speckling the four synthesized intensities.
Read chapter 4 for our work in progress in single-channel SAR speckle filtering.
We hope to go further speculating that: the speckle-filtering methodologies in dual-polarization SAR data is extensible to full polarimetric SAR data.

A fair amount of work has been carried out, published in two conference papers in 2010.
Still, as described in this report, the opportunities for further investigation are abundant. 

In the field of single channel SAR, further exploitation from the results of log-transformation should be achievable and publishable.
An immediate opportunity is identified as the estimation of the PDF of the underlying signal in SAR images. 
The mathematical construction and conceptualization was presented earlier, with implementation under-way.
In the medium term, a possible protocol for evaluation using homoskedastic mean squared error under various scenarios, made possible through simulation of different ground-truth PDFs is being conceptualized.

On the POLSAR front, the short term focus is to implement speckle filtering for the off-diagonal element in the target's covariance matrix.
The mathematical conceptualization has been given earlier, with a presentation planned as a paper for IGARSS 2011.
In a longer time frame, we are hoping to be able to apply log-transformation's homoskedastic features into POLSAR data to find a consistent measure of distance for one of the matrices representing the target's polarimetry signature.
We are also prepared to render help toward EADS's in-house project investigating the problem of ship identification / classification, ground-truth using AIS data. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion_final}

In conclusion, recent advances in computational power have made SAR and multiple-channel SAR become the preferred choice for continuous and autonomous global-scale earth observation and monitoring.
Some primitive systems have been implemented and become operational for such purposes, e.g. ship monitoring, which have show-cased the capability of the technology.
Recent advances in multi-channels polarimetric SAR have captured attention, not only within the academic community, but also from industrial players.

There are however certain issues need to be resolved to ensure the extra-information available in POLSAR data leads to better practical implementations.
%Our pilot study have exposed the trade off between higher-resolution in partial polarimetry modes and lower-resolution in images of full polarimetry, which apparently will continue to be around for many years to come.
%More importantly it exposed the need of a computational framework, to simulate, experiment and objectively evaluate the performance of different POLSAR processing techniques.
Our studies have exposed the need for a computation framework, to simulate, experiment, carry out statistical analysis, modelling, validation and evaluation of various SAR and POLSAR processing techniques, most of which can be put within the framework of statistical estimations.
Our work thus far has developed one such framework for the processing of single-channel SAR data.
In the next phase of the project, we aim to develop a more elaborated framework for multi-channel POLSAR data processing.

With the availability of such fundamental research, we can probably afford to follow a wider range of subsidiary research questions.
For the traditional single channel SAR, one sub-topic is our hypothesis that it is possible to estimate the PDF of the true, underlying back-scattering coefficient, at least in the log-transformed domain. 
Should we succeed in such a task, the technique could be an invaluable contributions to the whole class of MAP speckle filters.

Compared to single-channel SAR, the field of multi-channel POLSAR is much less mature. 
Thus the application of our intended framework can be expected to bring even better impact publications.
The first sub-topic that we aim for immediate experiment is the hypothesis that off-diagonal element in the polarimetric covariance matrix element can be speckle filtered through the application of standard SAR techniques on transformed polarization basis intensities.
In the longer term, we hope to investigate the extension of our homoskedastic log-transformation techniques towards finding a consistent measure for the multi-variate and stochastic POLSAR data.
%Should the experiments proved successful, an alternative and simpler way to statistically model off-diagonal element can be proposed.

%The previous chapter just elaborated a few of them, which showed the greatest potential and
%One of such key issues is the filtering of speckle, especially on off-diagonal covariance matrix elements, which also available in partial polarimetric data.

Presented here, and in the previous chapter, are just a few of a whole range of possibilities. 
With such a diversity available, one of our priorities is to be focused to achieve tangible results.
We merely choose to present only the sub-topics which showed the greatest potential and which we believe would provide the most impact and leverage for our future work.
For such tasks, a snap-shot of the project status and the amount of remaining activities is planned and presented in the previous section.
With continued assistance from EADS Innovation Works Singapore, who is a collaborator of this project and has provided us numerous valuable data and discussion, we believe that the remaining tasks are highly feasible.
The academic contribution was discussed earlier while the endorsement of EADS speaks volumes about the practical contributions of our research.
%We believe we have chosen a reasonable group of subsidiary research questions to focus, however we will be delighted to receive any feedback and suggestion from the readers.

%This project, in fact, is part of a collaboration with EADS on the field.
